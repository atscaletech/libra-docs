## Motivation
Global e-commerce growth has dramatically increased in recent years, expected to account for 12% of global consumer spending by 2025. While blockchain technologies have the potential to change many aspects of the financial systems and the broader economy, we are not seeing the mass adoption of e-commerce. Since faster transactions, security, and border-less make cryptocurrencies become the best candidate  for the next e-commerce payment, the poor user experience, and high risks are still the roadblocks to cryptocurrency payment in e-commerce. Libra was born to tackle this problem and help facilitate blockchain adoption in the eCommerce industry. Libra will bridges the gap between blockchain and eCommerce to enable all people to exchange value and transact globally, securely, at significantly lower cost, and more inclusively than traditional financial systems allow.

## What is Libra

Libra provides payment protocols such as lock-and-release payment, recurring payment, buy now pay later.
