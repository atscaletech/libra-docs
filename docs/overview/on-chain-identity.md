# On-chain identity

## Motivation
Despite cryptocurrencies having opened the door to a trust-less environment where people can make p2p transactions or interact with a decentralized economy using smart contracts, they are always at risk of bad behaviors because of the anonymity of the counter parties such as money laundering, or illegal transactions. This has led to the demand for an identifier system that allows those parties to evaluate each other before involving themselves further, while still maintaining the privacy and decentralization of cryptocurrencies.

## Libra identifier systems
The identifier system of the Libra is a decentralized identifier system that allows users to create a verifiable on-chain self-sovereign identity. The system includes four main parties:
- **Identity owner:** An organization or individual who owns an identity. This means that they can control their data and choose which data to expose and who can see their data. 
- **Identity consumer:** While the identity owner can control their data, the identity consumer can request to see an identity for risk evaluation before cooperating with that identity owner.
- **Identity evaluator:** It is hard to trust the information which is self-provided by the owner. The identity evaluator based on the triangle of trust model is introduced to help the owner prove the integrity of identity information. 
- **Credentials issuer:** Credential issuers are associated with organizations that allow identity owners to claim their credentials after the qualification process.

These parties are connected by the identity that is created from three key factors:

- **Self-provided information:** People can create their own on-chain identity by providing their personal information. They also can choose the evaluator who verifies their identity. The verification process is optional but highly recommended.
- **Credibility:** Each individual or organization can build their reputation for themselves by on-chain activity. While good behavior can help people to gain more reputation, it can be ruined by bad actions. The more on-chain reputation, the trustworthiness. 
- **Verifiable credentials:** In the on-chain sharing economy model which will be mentioned in chapter 6, the trust relationship becomes more complicated. The verifiable credentials are the qualification for an identity for a diploma or certificate of a specified skill. Let take freelance marketplace as an example, people usually need to have some skills to get the job and credentials is certificate to ensure the quality of these skills.
