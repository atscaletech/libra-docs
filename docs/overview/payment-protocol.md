# Payment Protocol
The Libra's heart is in payment protocols. Libra payment protocols, powered by blockchain technology, enable anyone from anywhere to create fast, secure, and low-fee payments by eliminating the participation of Â third financial institutions.

Libra offers numerous payment protocol options. Merchants can choose which payment protocol to offer to their customers based on their demand. The basic payment protocol is to transfer digital currencies directly from the buyer's wallet to the merchant's wallet. Furthermore, lock and release payment, recurring payment, and buy now pay later are all required for modern e-commerce.
